										<h1>The Brewing Process</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
										There are many ways to brew beer at home. Extract brewing, fresh wort kits and  brew in a bag are examples of how this can be done at home.
										The way that I brew beer is the all-grain method. Even within this realm of brewing, there are many different processes and techniques that can be used. In the 
										case of the following, I use a large water cooler with a false bottom for a lauder tun, large sauce pans for bringing water up to temperature and 
										boiling wort and plastic fermenters as the main items for my process. Part of the fun of brewing is to design your own methods and recipes, so, please only take this as an
										indication of my processes and a rough guide to how I operate, not as professional advice. A good place to start for people wanting to learn how to brew in a bit more depth (and where I started) is 
										John Palmer's website <a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/">How to Brew</a> (please note that while this is an awesome site, it does not run an SSL certificate and is not a secure connection ).

										<h3>1. Find a recipe</h3>
									  There are many resources on the internet that are great for this step. Finding a source that uses the system of measurement that you are used to is important (if you don't want to be converting all the time).
									  Since I live in Australia, I go by the metric system, so that is; grams, litres and degrees celcius. A good resource that usually has content in this system
									  is <a href="https://aussiehomebrewer.com/">Aussie Home Brewer</a> which is a forum for home brewing in Australia.<br\>
									  Once you have your recipe, you can order this at a local home brew store or online. The three main ingredients of brewing beer are, grain (usually malted barley), hops and yeast. 
									  Your grain will need to be milled, which if you don't own a mill, you can ask the store to do it for you.
									</p>

										<h3>2. Pepare</h3>
										Cleaning properly  is one of, if not THE most important part of brewing. Before you start to brew, it is necessary to clean everything thoroughly.
										Often brewing is broken down into two periods, 'hot side' and 'cold side'. Hot side is everything that you do in the process of making wort (I will go into this later)
										up until you turn off the heat after the boil of the wort. Cold side is after this period where the wort comes down and is stored for yeast to be added for fermentation.
										When it comes to cleaning, anything that is on the cold side of brewing need to be cleaned AND sanitised. You can sanitise equipment using products commonly available at home brew stores.
										Hot side equipment needs to be cleaned, however it is not necesarry to sanitise as the boil process will sort out any unwanted bacteria.									
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<p>
										<h3>3. Mash</h3>
									Now that you have your recipe, equipment that is clean and sanitised (if necessary), and your ingredients, it is time to brew. The first step is to 'mash' the grain.
									This is a process of steeping the grain in hot water for a peiod to draw out the fermentable sugars (mostly maltose) and flavours. This is done in what is known as a lauder tun. I use a large water
									cooler with a thermometer, a false bottom and lid as it is important to maintain a constant temperature throughout the mash process in most cases. This temperature is (in my case) around 66 degrees celcius and I usually hold this for an hour.
									Once the mash period is over it is time to transfer the liquid known as wort into a kettle for boiling. This is where the false bottom comes into play. The grain is essentially
									strained through the false bottom into the boil kettle. There is a process for this, for further information go to <a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/">How to Brew.</a>

									</p>

									<p>
										<h3>4. Boil</h3>
										The next step is to boil the sugary wort. This is to sanitise the wort, and to evapourate water to achieve the ideal gravity (sugar content). It is also 
										a chance to add flavour through hops. The boil process typically will last for one hour (once the wort is boiling) and throughout this hour
										hop additions are made to the kettle. Hops give different aromas and bitterness to the wort when added at different times. An early hop addition, say at
										the beginning of the boil is known as bittering hops because adding hops at this stage gives a bitter taste to the beer whereas hops added at the end of the boil will
										add aroma and not much bitterness. A recipe usually tells you what hops, how much and when to add them to the boil. At the end of the boil a whirlpool is made
										and last hops added. The whirpool helps drag the hop matter into a cone shape mound at the bottom of the kettle so it is easy to avoid when transferring wort out of
										the kettle.

										<h3>5. Chilling</h3>
										Once the boil is finished, we now need to chill the wort to a temperature that suits the yeast to begin fermentation. It is desirable to do this quickly
										to avoid chance of contamination. To chill the wort quickly, I use a wort chiller which is essentially a coil or manifold of copper tubing that I run cold 
										water through. This is held in the hot wort to bring the temperature down to an appropriate level which is generally somehwere below 30 degrees celcius. 
										There are many type of chillers available on the market, some are quicker than others, however for a reasonable price a wort chiller like the one I have is fine.
									
									</p>

									<p>
										<h3>6. Fermentation</h3>
										Now the wort is a good temperature for innoculating with yeast, we can transfer it to a fermenter. I do this transfer with a device called an auto syphon
									which is a tube of silicone with a pump on it to start the syphon flow. It is optimal to avoid as much hop matter and particulates (known as trub) as possible
								during the transfer. Once in the fermenter we can now add yeast. It is best to rehydrate yeast if using dry yeast prior to addition, however some varieties can be sprinkled onto 
								the top of the wort. Once innoculated, the yeast will start consuming sugar and producing alchohol. During this stage it is important to maintain a constant temperature. I do this 
								in an old fridge with a thermostat to turn the fridge off and on. Different beers/yeast require different temperatures, for an ale, I keep it at around 17-18 degrees celcius.
								Typically the fermentation process will take about 2 weeks.
									</p>

									<p>
										<h3>7. Bottling or Kegging</h3>
									The fermentation is finished and you are now ready to bottle or keg. For bottling the bottles must be cleaned and sanistised first. A little bit of extra sugar is 
									added to each bottle before filling for the yeast to eat, creating carbon dioxide in the sealed bottle to carbonate the beer. Once the bottle is filled and sealed with a 
									cap, the carbonation process (known as naturally carbonating) takes aproximately 2 weeks.</br>
									For kegging, the fermented wort is racked into a clean and sanitised keg and then crash chilled by putting it in the fridge. Once cold, the beer is then carbonated using pressurised carbon dioxide which is 
									pumped into the sealed keg at a high temperature for a period. I will not go into force carbonation anymore here, much can be found on the internet regarding this topic.
